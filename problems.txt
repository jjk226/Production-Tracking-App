problem:
When opening the app, time stamps are displayed in UTC, not EST.

solution:
use "heroku config:add TZ="America/New_York" " to set the config variables.
Key is "TZ" and Value is "America/New_York"

Ideally, the client side should convert UTC appropriately.

Problem:
Delete Button on each entry not working
